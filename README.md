## 🧑‍⚖️ Judging Criteria (Scoring Breakdown)

| Criteria                     | Max Points | Details |
|-----------------------------|------------|---------|
| **Model Type**              | 20         | Baseline models (e.g., Linear/Logistic Regression) get fewer points. Advanced models (e.g., XGBoost, CNN, LSTM) score higher. |
| **Accuracy & Evaluation**   | 20         | Higher accuracy and comprehensive evaluation (e.g., Confusion Matrix, RMSE, Precision-Recall) are rewarded. |
| **UI & App Features**       | 20         | Intuitive design, multiple pages, interactivity, and structured UI score better. |
| **Feature Engineering & Preprocessing** | 15 | Handling missing values, feature selection, data transformation, and augmentation. |
| **Overall Experience**      | 15         | App responsiveness, insights explanation, and result presentation. |
| **Bonus**                   | 10         | Innovative additions like explainability (e.g., SHAP), advanced visualizations, etc. |

**Total Points: 100**
