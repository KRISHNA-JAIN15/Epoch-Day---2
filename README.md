## Epoch - Neural Odyssey - Day – 2

Event Overview
•	Event Name: ML/DL Streamlit App Challenge
•	Duration: 2 hours
•	Team Size: 2–4 participants per team
•	Task: Build a machine learning/deep learning model on given datasets and create a fully functional Streamlit app with multiple features.
•	Judging Criteria: Model type, UI/UX, app features, accuracy, evaluation methods, and overall experience.

Judging Criteria (Scoring Breakdown)
Criteria	Max Points	Details
Model Type	20	Baseline models (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression) get fewer points. More complex models like XGBoost, CNN, LSTMs get higher points.
Accuracy & Evaluation	20	Higher accuracy and proper evaluation (confusion matrix, RMSE, precision-recall, etc.) get more points.
UI & App Features	20	Intuitive design, multiple pages, interactivity, and well-structured UI are rewarded.
Feature Engineering & Preprocessing	15	Handling missing values, feature selection, data transformation, and augmentation.
Overall Experience	15	App responsiveness, explanation of insights, and presentation of results.
Bonus	10	Innovative feature additions like explainability (SHAP), visualizations, etc.


Tech Setup & Guidelines
•	Required software: Python, Streamlit, Sklearn, XGBoost, TensorFlow (if deep learning is needed).
•	Participants must use Streamlit for UI.
•	Internet allowed to search for resources but no pre-trained models unless explicitly allowed.
